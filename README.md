# File Mod Tracker (CyberSec App)

Rust/Tauri Backend + React/Typescript Frontend + Vite

Completed basic file modification tracking logic in `main.rs`. The current implementation runs via the terminal, with print statements and writing to a `.txt` file. It's been interesting so far! It's surprising to see some specific desktop programs constantly performing I/O operations in the background.

Next steps:
- Additional cybersecurity features.
- Frontend.
- Connect backend + frontend.
